A basic ASP.NET Core 2 project with VueJS and Webpack

### Prerequisites

* NPM (via NodeJS install https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* .NET Core 2 SDK (via https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core or your favourite package manager)

### Getting started

Once you have NodeJS (and NPM), and the NET Core 2 SDK installed, run

```NPM install```

then

```NPM run build```

Thats it! A launch task for VSCode is part of the project, so it should just run.
